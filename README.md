# VueJS_DAWIN
Project done with Vue JS of a movie manager website. Here you can add, edit and delete movies. You're able to add rates and even put a poster on each movie you're managing. Just keep in mind that if you want to have your poster displayed correctly, you must put it in the "src/static" folder.
